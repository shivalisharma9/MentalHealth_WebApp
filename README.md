# MentalHealth_WepApp
# Mental Health Prediction Web App

## Overview
The **Mental Health Prediction Web App** is a multi-model machine learning application designed to assess and predict mental well-being based on various lifestyle, psychological, and work-related factors. The app predicts:

- **Stress Level (1-5 scale)**
- **Depression Risk (Yes/No)**
- **Burnout Status (Yes/No)**
- **Personalized Wellness Recommendations** (therapy, meditation, music, and relaxation needs)

The app performs **data analysis and visualization** to derive meaningful insights into mental health trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pickle
- **Machine Learning Models**: Various classification and regression algorithms
